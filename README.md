# LibMiletus

[LibMiletus](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/home.html) is a thin library that enables the interoperability among IoT devices.
It manages the announcement of the device in a local network and makes it easy the description of devices, enabling auto-configuration.

The libMiletus framework also runs on constrained devices such as ESP-8266 boards.

## Concepts

The main concepts of LibMiletus are described in [Overview](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/overview.html) page.

## Installation

For installation instructions, please, follow the [Getting Started](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/getting_started.html) steps at the official website.

## Contribution

It is not a full developed software.
You are welcome to request new libMiletus features and to report possible bugs.

You are also welcome to aggregate new features.
For that, check the [How to contribute] guide(http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/overview.html) and our [Whish List](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/wish_list.html) of projects.


## Examples

After the installation in the Arduino IDE, libMiletus examples will be available in the IDE (Menu: File -> Examples -> libMiletus -> ... )
For more examples, access our [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page. 


## Client Application
 
You can find a client library and a sample application in the [client-side](To.Be.Defined/clients/) page. 

## Supported Platforms

Currently, the supported platforms are:

 - NodeMCU
 - Linux

Since it is an Arduino library, you can expect the execution in other supported platforms.
For a more updated list, take a look at our [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page.

### Porting to another platform

You can find porting instructions also on the [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page.
