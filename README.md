# LibMiletus

[LibMiletus](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/home.html) is a lightweight library that provides interoperability functionalities for IoT devices.
It manages the announcement of a device in a local network and facilitates the description of devices, enabling auto-configuration.

The LibMiletus framework also runs on constrained devices such as [ESP8266 boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266).

## Concepts

The main concepts of LibMiletus are described in the [Overview](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/overview.html) page.

## Installation

For installation instructions, please follow the [Getting Started](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/getting_started.html) steps at the official website.

## Contribution

LibMiletus is still under development.
You are welcome to request new features and to report possible issues.

You are also welcome to aggregate new features.
For that, check the [How to contribute guide](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/overview.html) and our [Whish List](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/wish_list.html).

## Examples

After being installed in the Arduino IDE, LibMiletus' examples will be available under the menu "File -> Examples -> libMiletus -> ...".
For more examples, access our [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page. 

## Client Application
 
You can find a client library and a sample application in the [MiletusApp repository](https://github.com/MotorolaMobilityLLC/MiletusApp). 

## Supported Platforms

Currently, the supported platforms are:

 - NodeMCU
 - Linux

Since it is an Arduino library, you can expect LibMiletus to also run in other Arduino-supported platforms.
For a more up-to-date list, visit our [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page.

### Porting to Another Platform

You can find porting instructions on the [Supported Platforms](http://libmiletus.ic.unicamp.br/supported_platforms.html) page as well.
